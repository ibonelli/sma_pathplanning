Release history

v0.01
    From priorly built versions, created the first version I can fuse with other agents
v0.02
    Moved the current random agent to a class. I need to be able to use more than one agent and this is much cleaner.
v0.03
    New type of world, still using the random agent. This run shows that current obstacle detection has a bug.
v0.04
    Current version of the TangentBug moving into a new world and being a class too.
v0.05
    The attempt to detect if object is in path did not work as expected.
    New approach using segment to circle intersection to detect lidar limits.
    Detection seems to work better, but I still have problems finding right path.
v0.06
    Better detection of best path. But need to find better 3rd option and avoid random.
v0.07
    Works better for world2 after tweaking the lidar_object_limit.
    Still having problems detecting proper direction for world1.
v0.08
    Found a nasty bug which prevented proper limit calculation.
    Still have issues finding out best possible path.
    Quite obvious with world1 and at the begging of world2.
